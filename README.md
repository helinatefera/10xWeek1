# Financial News and Stock Price Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a large corpus of financial news data to discover correlations between news sentiment and stock market movements. The aim is to enhance predictive analytics capabilities by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and quantitative analysis.

## Approach

### 1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**
- Use Python libraries like `pandas` and `numpy` to load and preprocess the dataset.
- Standardize time formats and remove inconsistencies in text.

### 2. **Descriptive Statistics**
- Obtain basic statistics for textual lengths, such as headline lengths.
  - Example Metrics: Mean, Median, Minimum, Maximum lengths.
- Count the number of articles per publisher to identify the most active contributors.
- Analyze publication dates to determine trends over time:
  - Identify spikes in news frequency during major financial events or specific days of the week.

### 3. **Text Analysis (Sentiment Analysis & Topic Modeling)**
- Perform sentiment analysis on news headlines to gauge:
  - Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments.
- Use NLP techniques to extract:
  - Keywords or significant phrases (e.g., "FDA approval", "price target").
  - Topics or themes using methods like LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and TF-IDF.

### 4. **Time Series Analysis**
- Analyze publication frequency over time:
  - Are there spikes related to specific market events?
- Study publishing times to identify patterns:
  - Example: Most news released during pre-market hours (8 AM to 9 AM).

### 5. **Publisher Analysis**
- Identify the most active publishers contributing to the dataset.
- Examine differences in the type of news they report:
  - Financial reports, market trends, company earnings, etc.
- If publishers use email addresses, analyze unique domains to identify organizational contributors.

### 6. **Stock Price Analysis**
- Loading historical stock price data and calculating key indicators, such as daily returns and technical analysis indicators (Moving Averages, RSI).
### 7. **Correlation Analysis**:
- Investigating the statistical relationship between sentiment scores from the news headlines and stock price movements using Pearson correlation.
### 8.  **Visualizations**
- Creating plots to visually explore trends, sentiment distributions, stock price movements, and the correlation between sentiment and stock performance.
